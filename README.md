# 3:49am ðŸ‘»

3:49am ðŸ‘» is a tailwind based shopify theme built using my own starter theme [3am](https://github.com/Dhanush-git/3am-shopify).

## Usage

To get started clone the repo by clicking the **<> Code** button or by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhanush-git/349am.git
```

### Running the development server

To run the development server, you'll need to have [Shopify CLI](#shopify-cli) as well as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine.

1. Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Connect to your store

To connect your store update the `shopify.theme.toml` file with your store's information.

```toml
[environments.dev]
store = "3am.myshopify.com"
```

3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

After authenticating, this will start a local development server running at `https://localhost:9292` that you can use to preview your changes.

## Tools

There are a number of really useful tools that the Shopify Themes team uses during development. This theme is already set up to work with these tools.

### Shopify CLI

[Shopify CLI](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-cli) helps you build Shopify themes faster and is used to automate and enhance your local development workflow. It comes bundled with a suite of commands for developing Shopify themesâ€”everything from working with themes on a Shopify store (e.g. creating, publishing, deleting themes) or launching a development server for local theme development.

You can follow this [quick start guide for theme developers](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-cli#quick-start-guide-for-theme-developers) to get started.

### Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom storefront interfaces. It's a great way to build Shopify themes and sections quickly. You can find the configuration file at `tailwind.config.ts`.

### Theme Check

We recommend using [Theme Check](https://github.com/shopify/theme-check) as a way to validate and lint your Shopify themes.

Theme Check is a command line tool that runs a series of tests against your theme code to surface errors, deprecations, and potential bugs. It's a great way to ensure your theme is up to date with the latest best practices and that you're not using any deprecated Liquid or JSON fields.

You can also run it from a terminal with the following Shopify CLI command:

```bash
shopify theme check
```
